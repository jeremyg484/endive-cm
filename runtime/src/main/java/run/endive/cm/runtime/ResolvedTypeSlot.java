 * are different things that answer the same question, and comparing a declaration against what an
 * instance provides means holding one of each. What they have in common is the declaration as
 * parsed, the runtime identity if it names a resource type, and the resolved forms that make the
 * two comparable without either side needing to know the other's index space.
