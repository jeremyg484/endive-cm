/**
 * Static analysis backing the direct memory-to-memory transfer path. Distinguishes which
 * component-level types can move between two core module memories as a verbatim byte copy,
 * and which have to be walked because lifting and lowering are not each other's exact
 * inverse.
 *
 * <p>A type is <em>bitwise copyable</em> only if, for every possible byte pattern in the
 * source, {@code store(dst, load(src, t), t)} would reproduce those bytes unchanged. That
 * rules out more than it might first appear:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code bool} — a source byte of {@code 0x02} lifts to {@code true} and lowers back
 *       to {@code 0x01}.
 *   <li>{@code char} — lifting traps on surrogates and on values at or above {@code
 *       0x110000}, so the bytes must be inspected even though a valid one copies unchanged.
 *   <li>{@code flags} — lifting keeps only the low {@code labels.size()} bits and lowering
 *       re-packs the rest as zero, so a type with slack bits in its storage width needs
 *       masking. Flags that exactly fill their width ({@code 8}, {@code 16} or {@code 32}
 *       labels) have no slack and do copy verbatim.
 *   <li>{@code string} and unbounded {@code list} — the payload lives behind a pointer that
 *       must be re-allocated in the destination, and strings may additionally need
 *       transcoding.
 *   <li>{@code variant} (and its {@code enum}/{@code option}/{@code result} specializations),
 *       in which case the discriminant has to be range-checked against the case list.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Integers copy verbatim. Floats do as well {@code f32}/{@code f64} as the Canonical ABI
 * explicitly permits a host to preserve "the original value of the NaN before lifting, allowing
 * them to optimize away both the canonicalization of lifting and the randomization of lowering".
 *
 * <p>Aggregates are copyable when all of their leaves are. Padding inside a record and
 * between the elements of a fixed-size list is copied along with the fields, which
 * substitutes the source's undefined bytes for the destination allocator's, thus turning a record
 * of integers into a single copy.
 *
 * <p>All results assume the source and destination agree on {@link PointerType}; callers
 * establish that before consulting this class, because a differing pointer width changes
 * the layout of every pointer-sized field.
