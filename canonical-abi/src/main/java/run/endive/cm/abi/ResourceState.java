/**
 * The state of a resource handle in a component instance's {@link HandleTable}.
 *
 * <p>A handle is either <em>owning</em>, indicating it has the sole right to the underlying
 * resource, which lifting transfers out of the table, or <em>borrowed</em>, indicating it is
 * valid only for the duration of the call that lowered it. The two counters below are what
 * make that distinction enforceable at runtime:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #numLends} counts how many live {@code borrow} handles were lent <em>from</em>
 *       this handle. Canonical lifting of an {@code own} refuses to transfer ownership while
 *       it is non-zero, so a resource cannot be given away while a callee still holds a borrow
 *       of it.
 *   <li>{@link BorrowScope.Callee#numBorrows} on the {@link #borrowScope} counts borrows lowered
 *       <em>into</em> an export call, and must return to zero before that call may return.
 * </ul>
